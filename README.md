- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ol-Joshua-Kurian, "ol" is a nickname. I haven't applied myself to programming, but it is a neccesary skill to pursue some of my interests.
- At this point in time, I don't have any well developed interests. I would like to see the internet become a more multilingual space.
- ðŸŒ± In a week I'll take a course on logic. Won't be much. Besides that there are some seminars at UMBC on "lean", a formal language for math proofs. I missed the first meeting,
 but hopefully I'll get to the next.

- ðŸ“« At this point in time I will not share contact info.
